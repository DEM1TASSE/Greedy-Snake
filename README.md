The orange square represents food. Your goal is to guide the snake to eat the food.  
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).  
When the snake eats the food, it will grow longer by one unit, and a new piece of food will appear. Your score will increase by one.  
The score counter on the left side of the screen displays your current score.  
As your score reaches certain thresholds, the snake's movement speed will increase.  
If the snake's head collides with its own body, the game ends and you will be redirected to the Game Over screen.
