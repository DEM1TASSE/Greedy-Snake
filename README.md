The orange square represents food. Your goal is to guide the snake to eat the food.  
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).  
When the snake eats the food, it will grow longer by one unit, and a new piece of food will appear. Your score will increase by one.

As your score reaches certain thresholds, the snake's movement speed will increase.
